			<h2>Timetable:</h2>

			<p>This is our timetable for the first semester. The coloured blocks are our free slots, we are concentrating on them and we will give you some ideas what you can do in your free time.</p>
		</section>	
		<section class="sectionbox">
			<h1>Monday</h1>
				<p>Monday, the first day of the week. Luckily, we only have two lectures from 4pm. You can enjoy your lunch in bar one with your friends and play pool. This is an ideal way to start our week. (We wish every single day was like this)</p>

				<p>The activities zone is also suitable for you as you can play table tennis or monopoly there.
		</section>
		<section class="sectionbox">
			<h1>Tuesday</h1>
				<p>Although we only have two hours for lunch, you can always go to the students' union to have a nice lunch as it offers you a great variety of food choices. <a href="eating.html">More information about food here.</a></p>

				<img class="pic" src="./Images/unicentral.jpg" alt"Picture of Unicentral">
				<p>(I would suggest Unicentral because I love burger and fried chicken. Woohoo!!!)</p>
		</section>
		<section class="sectionbox">
			<h1>Wednesday</h1>
				<p>This is a busy day, however you can spend an hour in the student union at the end of your day after 5pm, as the Students' Union closes at 6pm.</p>
				<p>If you want to have a place to chill with your friends , the Foundry is your best choice. Every Wednesday night is a club night called ROAR which starts at 11.30pm. So you could go back home, take a nice bath and come back to have some fun in the middle of your busy week.</p>
		</section>
		<section class="sectionbox">
			<h1>Thursday</h1>
				<p>As we only have two free hours, my suggestion is to have a nice breakfast with cup of coffee before you start your day so you will have enough energy to get you through the day. So just have a look in Coffee Revolution before the first lecture.</p>
				<img class="pic" src="./Images/revolution.jpg" alt"Another picture of Cafe Revolution" width="500">
		</section>
		<section class="sectionbox">
			<h1>Friday</h1>
				<p>The day before weekend. Finish your works at the students' union so that you can enjoy your weekend. There are some comfortable places to study and the places are not packed with students.

		<section class="sectionbox">
			<h1>Saturday & Sunday</h1>
				<p>Yeeppy, it's weekend, however you could still go meet your friends at Bar One or in the Foundry and finally enjoy yourself after a hard week of studying.</p>
