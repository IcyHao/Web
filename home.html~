	<h1>About the website:</h1>
	<section class="sectionbox">
        <p>This website was created to show how you (Computer Science students) can make good use of our amazing Students' Union building. It offers many options including shopping facilities, study areas, coffee shops, eat-in and takeaway restaurants. We are focusing on how students like us can use this 
		huge building between lectures when we don't have time to walk back to Ranmoor or Endcliffe, or after Lectures when we want to study in a friendly and nice looking environment or meet with our assignment groups to discuss the next step towards getting maximum points. 
		You can find some more information about the Students' Union and its facilities below, however if you have any questions or doubts, feel free to fill out the form on the <a href="contact.html">Contact</a> page and we will get back to you as soon as we can!</p>

	<h1>Areas</h1>
	<section class="sectionbox">
		<p>This building has lots of useful and interesting areas which we can use whenever we want. For example there is a little "supermarket" where you can get basically anything you need. Whenever you are short on time
			just pay a visit there. When it comes to entertainment you could ask what's on at the Box-office and they can help you choose the perfect programme to take your mind off studying. If you lost your UCard do not worry, 
			you can get a new one at the SSiD desk where you can get answers for your questions no matter what it is about. If all you want is a quiet place to revise, you can find it here as well. To find more information about the specific areas, head to the <a href="areas.html">Areas</a> page.

	<h1>Our Week</h1>
	<section class="sectionbox">
		<p>We know that our timetable can be really busy at times, but don't worry, you still have time to enjoy this buildings facilities. On our "Our Week" page
			we can give you a few tricks&tips how you could manage your time and enjoy it at the same time. Click on this link if you are interested: <a href="ourweek.html">Our Week</a>

	<h1>Eating</h1>
	<section class="sectionbox">
		<p>We know that concentrating for a long time takes up so much energy which we have to replace somehow in a really quick way. Because of our tight timetable, most of the time we only have an hour between lectures to grab something to eat. In this case the Students' Union building is the place to go as it offers a wide range of food 
			options for any kind of diet. You could get a sandwich from the Student Store, or a healthy wrap from New Leaf, or a burger from Global Street Food, and I could carry on listing all the options you have, but it's probably better if you check it out yourself. In order to do so, <a href="eating.html">click on this link.</a></p>
