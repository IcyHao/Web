		<h1>Studying Spaces</h1>

		<h1>Support Services</h1>
		<section class="sectionbox">
					<h2>Student Services Information Desk</h2>
					<p>This is the first place to go if you have any problems or questions regarding the university. Personally I think this is the heart of the Students' Union. You could ask for a "proof of student status" paper if you need one or 
						if you lost your UCard, you can get a new one here, or literally whatever your problem is they can help you here, so make sure you remember this place!

				<h2>Student Support & Guidance</h2>
				<p>Are you an international student with problems, or having financial hardship? The Student Support & Guidance desk is the place to go. Remember, it's not an embarassing thing to have problems, everybody has problems, the most important thing is to 
					make sure people know about your problems and if not, feel free to ask for some help!
